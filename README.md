Tool to set up new macOS devices.

##v .1
###Intent: to set up new _personal_ macOS devices with minimal interaction by the user.
###Process/User Experience:
1. User runs `curl thregan.com/geck | zsh ` to download the main script and run it. User interaction ends. Script execution begins and performs the following:
2. Install any and all ï£¿ software updates. If a restart is necessary, the terminal will re-open and resume running the script after the install.
3. Install Xcode developer tools.
5. Install all brews/casks from brewfile manifest.
6. Download and set .zshprofile file.
7. Install latest version of python via pyenv.
8. Install all apps from Mac App Store from mac_app_store manifest file.
9. Install autokpkg.
10. Install all items in autopkg recipes list manifest.

Speedbumps to consider:
- macOS Gatekeeper app authorization for apps downloaded from ther Internet.
- Some installation steps will require the terminal session to be restarted. How can the script resume automatically where it left off and continue printing progress messages in the terminal.
